<h1 align='center'><strong>A* Algorithm with Interactive Visualization</strong></h1>
This project demonstrates the implementation of the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a graph. The interactive visualization allows you to adjust the number of nodes and the search speed, displaying the search process in real-time. It's ideal for students and enthusiasts who want to understand and visualize the workings of the A* algorithm.

### Features
  - Interactive Visualization: Watch the A* algorithm in action with a graphical representation of nodes and edges.
  + Adjustable Parameters: Control the number of nodes and the search speed directly from the interface.
  * Custom Node Names: Intermediate nodes are named as A1, A2, B1, B2, etc., for easy identification.
  - Real-time Results: The found path is highlighted and displayed directly on the page.
